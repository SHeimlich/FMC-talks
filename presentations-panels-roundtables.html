                <p>This case study provides a roadmap for maximizing the impact of your outreach endeavors specifically tailored to creating sustainable FIRST communities, not just starting teams. We discuss the importance of meeting your audience where they are, forming alliances with community groups, and securing funding through sponsors and grants. Additionally, we emphasize the value of active listening, empowering participants to continue initiatives independently. By fostering collaboration and maintaining a forward-thinking approach, you can propel your outreach efforts to new heights.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>The goal of this presentation is to give people an idea of how to approach debugging issues with their robots at events and at home. This presentation will be given from the perspective of talking through how a CSA (Control Systems Advisor) at an event would typically approach helping a team with various types of electrical and software issues. In doing this a few topics will get covered (presentation timing depending):
                    * General robot debugging processes and approaches, with a focus on how this applies at events.
                    * Enumeration of common issues to watch out for, and what resources are available to help.
                    * Some discussion of the volunteer <-> team interaction involved with CSA'ing.
                    * Some discussion of how the CSA volunteer role works.</p>

                <p>I have been CSA'ing at events for ~9 years now and have spent copious amounts of time dealing with robot debugging & bringup both with my team and professionally.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>In 1999 I began mentoring Team 255, Foothill Continuation High School, in the East Side Union District of San Jose, CA. In their first season at the Nationals at Epcot, Team 255 finished in the bottom 10%.  In 2000, just 1 year later they captained the Championship Alliance.  One of the team co-captains had been involved in a street gang, and as a result of the competition won a 4 year scholarship to UC Berkeley. 10 of the graduating seniors went on to 4 year colleges, a remarkable result for a school whose main aspiration was to grant GEDs.

                    I believe 3 key principles: Passion - Planning - Perseverance - were the keys to their success.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Each FIRST team has different mentors, parents, students, and community engagement opportunities. 
                    The FIRST Fundraising Toolkit offers excellent advice on how to create a team fundraising plan with fill-in-the-blank resources, videos, and example fundraisers from teams within FIRST, but how do you put the FIRST Fundraising Toolkit to work for your team, in your community, and with the resources you currently have? 
                    During this session, we will start with a high-level review of the resources in the FIRST Fundraising Toolkit and then spend the majority of our time walking through how to build your team's confidence in asking for sponsorships from local organizations. You will walk away with a series of 15min to 30min team activities that break down the sponsorship request process into bite sized pieces for your students. 
                    This will contain new content, beyond the original Fundraising Toolkit, focusing on building your students' confidence in fundraising. 
                    We recommend you take a look at the Fundraising Toolkit to familiarize yourself with the already existing resources - <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/fundraising-toolkit">https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/fundraising-toolkit</a></p>
        
                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>As a student in FIRST, Renee Becker-Blau discovered her passion for community building, laying the foundation for a remarkable twenty-year journey. Throughout this time, she actively volunteered in all FIRST programs, mentoring over 22 teams, and immersing herself in the fields of youth development and nonprofit management.

                    Through these formative experiences, Renee cultivated the belief that every student, regardless of gender, race, or socioeconomic background, should have the opportunity to choose if they would like to pursue a career in STEM, rather than having that choice predetermined by life circumstances or zip code.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, most FRC events are not won or lost during a match, but during alliance selection. Learn how to use scouting data to make a pick list, navigate the alliance selection process, and make a good impression on alliance captains in order to have your best shot at a blue banner. We'll discuss best practices, case studies, and common mistakes for all things alliance selection.</p>
        
                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>During my 7 seasons as a mentor on FRC 2791 Shaker Robotics (2016-2019) and FRC 333 MEGALODONS (2020-present), I've focused on getting my students excited about analyzing scouting data and scheming up winning strategies. Smart scouting and picking has helped both teams punch above their weight at regionals and offseason events, bringing home 4 regional wins and 7 offseason wins in that time. I love sharing the lessons I've learned over the years, which I've done in past conference presentations, the Gettin' Picky series that Katie Widen and I wrote together, and my Chief Delphi ramblings.</p>

                <p>This session is intended for mentors from around the country to share resources and experiences related to hosting inclusion events both during team meetings, inter-team socials and local competitions.  The focus of this session is improving engagement and retainment of underrepresented and underserved populations in FRC including girls, Black youth and LGBTQ+ communities.  This session will be small group discussions where we believe we can achieve greater knowledge sharing.

                    These are three continuous event series where we invite industry professionals and engineers to connect and network with underrepresented communities in FIRST. We recognize that many of these students do not have mentors or even other students on their team they identify with (or look like). We strive to use this event as a bridge that allows underrepresented youth to meet their role models and others their age making lasting connections.</p>

                <h2>Networking and Strengthening Your Local FRC Community</h2>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>A key part of improving your team and local FRC community is building a strong local network of mentors. Things like mentor workshops, geographically based slacks, visits to other teams shops, and invitations to other teams to come to your shop are things that can help improve everyone in the process. 

                    This workshop will be a mix of presentation and discussion about why it matters, what has worked for some, what hasn't worked and why, and the timing for building a good local network. 
                    
                    This is targeted for both those that can offer support and those looking to receive support. In reality, many teams might be in a position for both; I routinely hear from top teams about support they received from others along the way. When digging into the data about team attrition rate, we believe there is a strong correlation between teams that survive and mentors that build a network of support</p>
        
                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>Andrew Hartnett has been in FRC since 2005, having taken off 2008 - 2010 and founded and is lead mentor for FRC5414, Pearadox. Pearadox has won a district champs culture changing award 2020-2023, and has been an event finalist numerous times since 2019. This success didn't come from Pearadox's inception however, as they steadily improved every year after struggling on the field from their rookie year. Networking was a key part in Pearadox's growth and success as an FRC organization.

                    Additionally, Andrew has co-hosted FRC Mentor workshops with WFA Allen Gregory and fellow WFFA Scott Rippetoe for the past few years. In 2022 Allen, Scott, and Andrew were asked to bring the mentor workshop ""on the road"" and hosted workshops in San Antonio and Dallas in addition to the annual Houston mentor workshop and are currently working to encourage local mentors in those areas to continue those this year. Andrew also helps to manage the Texas Mentors slack</p>

Drawing from her personal experience and witnessing the transformative power of the FIRST program, she is dedicated to fostering inclusive environments where communities can thrive.
                    
                    With a Bachelor of Science degree in Scientific & Technical Communication and a Master's degree in Nonprofit Management, Renee effectively leveraged her expertise to expand student access to the FIRST program, both her tenure with FIRST Indiana Robotics (2013-2023) and as the current President of FIRST Wisconsin. 
                    
                    A community building, trailblazing, #STEMINIST, she firmly believes that our future is built better together. </p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Much like a robot, running a youth development organization involves a lot of effectively moving parts. Whether you are a veteran or rookie mentor, in this workshop you will discover practical tips for building sustainable systems and improve your team’s efficiency in areas like organizational, communications, and finance.

                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>Norman Morgan began FRC 2468 Team Appreciate in 2008. He brings 37 years of successful classroom & athletic coaching experience to his program. Drawing upon past knowledge & personal interactions, his program is modeled after previous coaching & leadership roles from athletics, yearbook & student council. His program has grown from 35 students in 2008 to a yearly participation of 160+ high school students competing in FRC &FTC. For the past four years, his program based at Westlake High School in Austin, Texas has fielded multiple FRC teams from the same school, utilized the same mentors/teachers & work space for the teams. The program has experienced growth since day one & has been managed in a variety of ways including seven FTC teams & one FRC team to now two FTC teams & three FRC teams( FRC 2468, FRC 2687 & FRC 2689) for 125+ students each year.  He depends heavily on trusting his mentors and student leadership for day to day operations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>I plan to present on how Spectrum 3847 and Photon 8515 run as two teams under one roof. Our system is different than most other sibling team models as all students are on both teams. 8515 is our development team and is for 9th grade students and 10th grade students that are new to our team. It allows them to get much more experience with assembly early in their careers. We also have a limited number of students and mentors (40ish students and 4 technical mentors) across both teams.</p>
        
                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>We have run our development team model since 2021. I have 21 years of FRC experience, 2019 Woodie Flowers Award Recipient. 

                    I struggled deciding what to choose to present, so if there is another topic that you all want to see done, I'm happy to do that as well. I'm pretty confident I could do most anything for the rookie track outside of finance/fundraising stuff. Event logistics, MCC/everybot stuff, CAD, shop setup, Laser cutters/3d printers, etc.</p>

                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>My presentation will focus on how to use FIRST-based curriculum and inclusive teaching practices to promote diversity, equity and inclusion within a FRC team as well as to maximize student learning and engagement in the offseason and build season. On 7407, using FRC-based curriculum in our fall, spring and summer training programs have proven massively effective in preparing students to take major ownership of the robot during build season, reaching different types of learners, including neurodivergent students, recruiting underrepresented students in STEM into the team, as well as growing confidence and self esteem in all students. This conference will go over how to build different FRC-based projects into classroom settings as well as FRC team training. We will also discuss how to couple these projects with inclusive teaching practices to maximize student learning and engagement, challenge our own internal biases to become better educators, and ensure no students get left behind. </p>
            
                    <h2>Bio</h2>
                    <p>I started in FRC as a junior in high school on Team 20 based out of Shenendehowa High School in Clifton Park, NY. After taking on the drive coach role my senior year, I was absolutely hooked on FIRST and wanted to continue my journey as a mentor, and have been mentoring for 11 years now in FRC & FLL, and have started 2 FRC teams and 10 FLL teams. However, I faced serious sexism and bias inside and outside of my team as a student and mentor and have been determined to change the culture within FIRST to ensure all students have equal opportunities and are treated with respect regardless of lived experience. As a former working engineer and current math & robotics teacher, I have gained a wholistic perspective on what students need to be prepared for engineering school and industry, as well as what different types of students need to learn and thrive in a STEM environment. </p>

                    <p>Need a good foundation to start an FRC team whether for yourself or for teams you are mentoring? FRC 2468 has utilized EveryBot and similar programs to mentoring eight rookies teams over the past seven years.  Utilizing these programs in the months leading up to FRC season kickoff can establish the foundation for a successful start to a season.  Clearly defined goals and understanding how the goals relate to the modeled program builds allow a team to focus on getting a robust robot built to tackle the season challenge.  A team who experiences success at a tournament will more than likely be more successful at the next tournament or will be motivated to improve for the next season.  FRC 2468 utilizes this system to train and develop our FRC 2689 Team Alpha students to develop a foundation within the novice FRC students.  </p>

                    <p>FRC 2468 has mentored eight rookie teams in FRC over the past seven years.  Four of those teams utilized a planned robot (MCC, StarterBot or EveryBot) for two seasons with minor modifications.  All of the teams successfully competed in the all of the playoffs the teams competed in for their seasons.  Success on the field starts at home during build seasons.  We have utilized these principles not only to train our rookie FRC students in our program at FRC 2468 but also at the other teams we have mentored as well.  Offseason plans will be provided on how to break down past seasons so that teams will be prepared to get a good start to the season at kickoff.  </p>
